# Burger-App
A Node Express Handlebars restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever an user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the page--waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting are also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move.

The app will store every burger in the MySQL database, whether devoured or not.
